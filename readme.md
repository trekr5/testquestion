 This repository contains my sample Bash shell code for the fizz buzz challenge.
 ffffffffffff

 FIZZBUZZ 30 6 12

 The fizz buzz challenge requests that you design a script that can print all numbers from 1 to any limit (in  this case 30) but for all numbers divisible by the second parameter, in this case 6, prints "Fizz"  and for numbers divisible by the third parameter, in this case 12, prints "Buzz" and for all numbers divisible by the second and third parameters,  prints "FizzBuzz".

 I also included an error message that would display if less than 3 parameters were entered on the command line.
